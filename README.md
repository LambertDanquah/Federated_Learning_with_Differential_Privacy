# Federated_Learning_with_Differential_Privacy

The main points include 
1. FedAvg was used as the aggregation function for collaborative training of the deep learning model by four (4) clients.
2. TensorFlow Privacy was used to implement differential privacy (DP-Adam, a variant of DP-SGD).
3. XGBoost-generated feature importance was used for Feature Selection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction, contributing to reduction in computational complexity
4. Multi-Layer Perceptron with 4 hidden layers had the lowest computational complexity and highest Mirai botnet attack detection rate.
5. Performance metrics included: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Area Under the Curve, Confusion Matrix, number of FLoating-point OPerations (FLOPs)
